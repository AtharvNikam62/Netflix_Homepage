"Netflix Homepage Clone: HTML &amp; CSS Project ðŸŽ¥ðŸ”¥

A fun and educational project where I recreated the iconic Netflix homepage using HTML and CSS. 
Explore the world of web development as I showcase my skills in front-end design and layout. 
Dive into the code to see how I've implemented responsive design, custom CSS animations, 
and more to replicate the Netflix user experience. 
Feel free to fork, star, or contribute to this project as we continue to learn and grow in the world of web development together! ðŸš€ðŸ“º
